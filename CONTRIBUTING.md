1. Each contribution can have an issue, doesn't require it though. \
   It'll be required if you create a larger PR such as `Ported IceSDK to iOS` \
   and something similar.
   
2. Each contribution cannot directly be pushed from master into master and must be in a separate branch.

3. Each contribution cannot fix just a single typo or add useless nonsense like `Renamed .gn -> ThIs iS aN AwesoMe proJeCT.gn`.

4. Each contribution must follow the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

5. Each contribution If possible, document your code of what it should do (not what it does). \
   it's not required though, it's just good practice.
